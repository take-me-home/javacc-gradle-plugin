| **inputFile**                                           | `File`         |                                                     | The input jj-File for the code generation.                   |
| **packageName**                                         | `String`       |                                                     | A special package name for the code generation. The output directory will be extended with this configuration. |
| The following variables are integer variables.          |                |                                                     |                                                              |
| **lookahead**                                           | `int`          |                                                     | LOOKAHEAD: The number of tokens to look ahead before making a decision at a choice point during parsing. The default value is 1.<br>The smaller this number, the faster the parser. This number may be overridden for specific productions within the grammar as described later.<br>See the description of the lookahead algorithm for complete details on how lookahead works. |
| **choiceAmbiguityCheck**                                | `int`          |                                                     | CHOICE\_AMBIGUITY\_CHECK: This is an integer option whose default value is 2.<br>This is the number of tokens considered in checking choices of the form "A |
| **otherAmbiguityCheck**                                 | `int`          |                                                     | OTHER\_AMBIGUITY\_CHECK: This is an integer option whose default value is 1.<br>This is the number of tokens considered in checking all other kinds of choices (i.e., of the forms "(A)\*", "(A)+", and "(A)?")<br>for ambiguity. This takes more time to do than the choice checking, and hence the default value is set to 1 rather than 2. |
| The following variables will be interpreted as boolean. |                |                                                     |                                                              |
| **staticParam**                                         | `String`       |                                                     | STATIC: This is a boolean option whose default value is true.<br>If true, all methods and class variables are specified as static in the generated parser and token manager.<br>This allows only one parser object to be present, but it improves the performance of the parser.<br>To perform multiple parses during one run of your Java program, you will have to call the ReInit()<br>method to reinitialize your parser if it is static. If the parser is non-static, you may use the "new" operator<br>to construct as many parsers as you wish. These can all be used simultaneously from different threads. |
| **supportClassVisibilityPublic**                        | `String`       |                                                     | SUPPORT\_CLASS\_VISIBILITY\_PUBLIC: This is a boolean option whose default value is true.<br>The default action is to generate support classes (such as Token.java, ParseException.java etc) with Public visibility.<br>If set to false, the classes will be generated with package-private visibility. |
| **debugParser**                                         | `String`       |                                                     | DEBUG\_PARSER: This is a boolean option whose default value is false.<br>This option is used to obtain debugging information from the generated parser. Setting this option to true causes<br>the parser to generate a trace of its actions. Tracing may be disabled by calling the method disable\_tracing()<br>in the generated parser class. Tracing may be subsequently enabled by calling the method enable\_tracing() in the generated parser class. |
| **debugLookahead**                                      | `String`       |                                                     | DEBUG\_LOOKAHEAD: This is a boolean option whose default value is false.<br>Setting this option to true causes the parser to generate all the tracing information it does when the option<br>DEBUG\_PARSER is true, and in addition, also causes it to generated a trace of actions performed during lookahead operation. |
| **debugTokenManager**                                   | `String`       |                                                     | DEBUG\_TOKEN\_MANAGER: This is a boolean option whose default value is false.<br>This option is used to obtain debugging information from the generated token manager. Setting this option to true causes<br>the token manager to generate a trace of its actions. This trace is rather large and should only be used when you have a<br>lexical error that has been reported to you and you cannot understand why. Typically, in this situation, you can determine<br>the problem by looking at the last few lines of this trace. |
| **errorReporting**                                      | `String`       |                                                     | ERROR\_REPORTING: This is a boolean option whose default value is true.<br>Setting it to false causes errors due to parse errors to be reported in somewhat less detail. The only reason to set<br>this option to false is to improve performance. |
| **javaUnicodeEscape**                                   | `String`       |                                                     | JAVA\_UNICODE\_ESCAPE: This is a boolean option whose default value is false.<br>When set to true, the generated parser uses an input stream object that processes Java Unicode escapes (\\u…) before<br>sending characters to the token manager. By default, Java Unicode escapes are not processed. This option is ignored if<br>either of options USER\_TOKEN\_MANAGER, USER\_CHAR\_STREAM is set to true. |
| **unicodeInput**                                        | `String`       |                                                     | UNICODE\_INPUT: This is a boolean option whose default value is false.<br>When set to true, the generated parser uses uses an input stream object that reads Unicode files. By default,<br>ASCII files are assumed. This option is ignored if either of options USER\_TOKEN\_MANAGER, USER\_CHAR\_STREAM is set to true. |
| **ignoreCase**                                          | `String`       |                                                     | IGNORE\_CASE: This is a boolean option whose default value is false.<br>Setting this option to true causes the generated token manager to ignore case in the token specifications and the input files.<br>This is useful for writing grammars for languages such as HTML. It is also possible to localize the effect of IGNORE\_CASE<br>by using an alternate mechanism described later. |
| **commonTokenAction**                                   | `String`       |                                                     | COMMON\_TOKEN\_ACTION: This is a boolean option whose default value is false.<br>When set to true, every call to the token manager’s method "getNextToken" (see the description of the Java Compiler Compiler API)<br>will cause a call to a used defined method "CommonTokenAction" after the token has been scanned in by the token manager.<br>The user must define this method within the TOKEN\_MGR\_DECLS section. The signature of this method is: void CommonTokenAction(Token t) |
| **userTokenManager**                                    | `String`       |                                                     | USER\_TOKEN\_MANAGER: This is a boolean option whose default value is false.<br>The default action is to generate a token manager that works on the specified grammar tokens. If this option is set<br>to true, then the parser is generated to accept tokens from any token manager of type "TokenManager" - this interface<br>is generated into the generated parser directory. |
| **userCharStream**                                      | `String`       |                                                     | USER\_CHAR\_STREAM: This is a boolean option whose default value is false.<br>The default action is to generate a character stream reader as specified by the options JAVA\_UNICODE\_ESCAPE and UNICODE\_INPUT.<br>The generated token manager receives characters from this stream reader. If this option is set to true, then the token manager<br>is generated to read characters from any character stream reader of type "CharStream.java". This file is generated into the<br>generated parser directory. This option is ignored if USER\_TOKEN\_MANAGER is set to true. |
| **buildParser**                                         | `String`       |                                                     | BUILD\_PARSER: This is a boolean option whose default value is true.<br>The default action is to generate the parser file ("MyParser.java" in the above example). When set to false, the parser<br>file is not generated. Typically, this option is set to false when you wish to generate only the token manager and use<br>it without the associated parser. |
| **buildTokenManager**                                   | `String`       |                                                     | BUILD\_TOKEN\_MANAGER: This is a boolean option whose default value is true.<br>The default action is to generate the token manager file ("MyParserTokenManager.java" in the above example).<br>When set to false the token manager file is not generated. The only reason to set this option to false is to save<br>some time during parser generation when you fix problems in the parser part of the grammar file and leave the lexical<br>specifications untouched. |
| **tokenManagerUsesParser**                              | `String`       |                                                     | TOKEN\_MANAGER\_USES\_PARSER: This is a boolean option whose default value is false.<br>When set to true, the generated token manager will include a field called parser that references the instantiating parser<br>instance (of type MyParser in the above example). The main reason for having a parser in a token manager is using some of<br>its logic in lexical actions. This option has no effect if the STATIC option is set to true. |
| **sanityCheck**                                         | `String`       |                                                     | SANITY\_CHECK: This is a boolean option whose default value is true.<br>JavaCC performs many syntactic and semantic checks on the grammar file during parser generation. Some checks such as<br>detection of left recursion, detection of ambiguity, and bad usage of empty expansions may be suppressed for faster<br>parser generation by setting this option to false. Note that the presence of these errors (even if they are not detected<br>and reported by setting this option to false) can cause unexpected behavior from the generated parser. |
| **forceLaCheck**                                        | `String`       |                                                     | FORCE\_LA\_CHECK: This is a boolean option whose default value is false.<br>This option setting controls lookahead ambiguity checking performed by JavaCC. By default (when this option is false),<br>lookahead ambiguity checking is performed for all choice points where the default lookahead of 1 is used. Lookahead<br>ambiguity checking is not performed at choice points where there is an explicit lookahead specification, or if the option<br>LOOKAHEAD is set to something other than 1. Setting this option to true performs lookahead ambiguity checking at all choice<br>points regardless of the lookahead specifications in the grammar file. |
| **cacheTokens**                                         | `String`       |                                                     | CACHE\_TOKENS: This is a boolean option whose default value is false.<br>Setting this option to true causes the generated parser to lookahead for extra tokens ahead of time. This facilitates<br>some performance improvements. However, in this case (when the option is true), interactive applications may not work<br>since the parser needs to work synchronously with the availability of tokens from the input stream. In such cases, it’s<br>best to leave this option at its default value. |
| **keepLineColumn**                                      | `String`       |                                                     | KEEP\_LINE\_COLUMN: This is a boolean option whose default value is true.<br>If you set this option to false, the generated CharStream will not have any line/column tracking code. It will be your<br>responsibility to do it some other way. This is needed for systems which don’t care about giving error messages etc. |
| The following variables will be interpreted as string.  |                |                                                     |                                                              |
| **tokenExtends**                                        | `String`       |                                                     | TOKEN\_EXTENDS: This is a string option whose default value is "", meaning that the generated Token class will extend java.lang.Object.<br>This option may be set to the name of a class that will be used as the base class for the generated Token class. |
| **tokenFactory**                                        | `String`       |                                                     | TOKEN\_FACTORY: This is a string option whose default value is "", meaning that Tokens will be created by calling Token.newToken().<br>If set the option names a Token factory class containing a public static Token newToken(int ofKind, String image) method. |
| **jdkVersion**                                          | `String`       |                                                     | JDK\_VERSION: This is a string option whose default value is "1.8" |
